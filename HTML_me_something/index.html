				<h3 id="bolden">Trip Purpose</h3>
				<p>Aleidra and I set our on this trip to make the most of our Valentine's Day.  We also wanted to stay on a budget and not go broke.  Luckily, Southwest had some great fares 						for us to go to Denver, a place we've never been, on the cheap. Spoiler alert: We were not disappointed.</p>

				<h3>Sights to See</h3>
				<p>We wanted to make sure we checked out quite a few sites in Denver.  First, we arrived at the airport.  After that, we checked out the Pepsi Center and saw the Warriors get beaten pretty badly by the Nuggets.  On our second day, we checked out the MCA.  We also went to go get some painting done too.  The last day we spent some time in Boulder, CO.</p>
